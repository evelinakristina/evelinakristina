        "### Background\n",
        "\n",
        "The UK Government has introduced a policy in an effort to reduce carbon emissions in London. If a vehicle does not meet emissions standards and isn't exempt, drivers must pay a £12.50 daily charge to drive within the central London zone. This applies to cars, motorcycles, vans, specialist vehicles and minibusses. It is known as the “Ultra Low Emission Zone” ([ULEZ](https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/driving/ultra-low-emission-zone)). The motivation of the policy is to encourage commuters and residents to swap to electric vehicles or more green methods of transportation.\n",
        "\n",
        "There has been growing international interest and pressure on governments to do more as a part of the green transition, including a reduction in carbon emissions and dependency on fossil fuels. Leaders are facing backlash from climate scientists and activists as well as the general public for not doing enough. Policy makers and Members of Parliament (MPs) in the UK had the objective to address air pollution by reducing the amount of emissions in London, the largest and most polluting city in the UK. In the UK, the impact of air pollution is [estimated](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/air-pollution-applying-all-our-health/air-pollution-applying-all-our-health#:~:text=to%2Dday%20practice.-,Why%20we%20focus%20on%20the%20health%20effects%20of%20air%20pollution,and%2036%2C000%20deaths%20every%20year.) to be equivalent to between 28,000 and 36,000 premature deaths per year. To address this, they introduced the Low Emission Zone (LEZ) in 2019 which was extended in August 2023 to include a larger perimeter of London, renamed ULEZ. Mayor Khan himself is personally committed to this policy as outlined in his book, \"[Breathe: Tackling the Climate Emergency](https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/452035/breathe-by-khan-sadiq/9781529152784)\".\n",
        "\n",
        "Despite being considered an essential, timely and necessary policy, there has been massive backlash. Critics say there will not be an overall reduction in emissions and rather there has been an increased cost burden on lower income families who cannot afford to upgrade to electric vehicles. As the face of the policy, Mayor Khan has personally been a victim of harassment and abuse as a result of instating the policy. Several signs point to the removal of this policy but what are the alternative green policy initiatives available for London? What are Londoners truly upset by and what can the government do to introduce more equitable, inclusive and effective green policy?\n",
        "\n",
        "This study is a sentiment analysis understanding public opinion on ULEZ and will  address the following research question: Will the Ultra Low Emission Zone policy offset carbon emissions in London and how can understanding the public’s reaction to ULEZ help improve the UK’s green transition and inform future policy?\n",

Firstly, at a meeting in March 2022 Khan was asked where he got the data that the poorest Londoners would not be affected as they don’t own cars. Khan was challenged on this response and was asked where he got his statistics from. Khan seemed to confuse the question and it was rephrased asking specifically for the source of that data Khan was referring to. Khan then resorted to using personal attacks to what was a perfectly reasonable question to provide evidence to support his claims. He is an example of another politician that does not have the right character, competence, and level of integrity to serve in the best interests of the public. It was brought up again by Peter Fortune a year later and once again he had nowhere to hide. \r\n",

            "The assessed air pollution benefits from the expansion of ULEZ shows no meaningful evidence to support TFL’s claim that the expansion of ULEZ would make a significant difference to London's air quality. It was therefore an easy decision to expand ULEZ as it is solely about implementing a larger catchment area for motorist in London (5.1 million) and those motorists that live outside London but enter the outskirts of Greater London. If Khan had actually researched the actual statistics instead of making up stats to base his assumptions on he would have been in a position to make an informed decision. How long would it have taken for TFL or his office to have compiled or found this data set before committing? Simply denying the impact on low-income households while making false claims of the health benefit does not fix the issue. The London Mayors office and TFL have essentially expanded the ULEZ zone without any proper facts-based consultation. It is also worth stating that if it is an air pollution levy and not a motoring toll why are the profits going to TFL and not say to a charity such as the Heart Foundation Charity or the NHS that support and treat those people effected by air pollution. \r\n",

            "Furthermore, it is well known that the highest level of air pollution is not at street level, but on the underground network where measured air pollution is measured as toxic to human health and being forced to use the London Underground is worse for your health. If Khan genuinely cared about reducing the health impacts of air pollution on Londoners, he would be focused on improving fresh air ventilation and other measures to improve air quality on the London Underground network. Sadiq Khan should also note that commuters travelling on the London Underground from Greater London (and outside London) into Central London and back are exposed more to this toxic air on a daily basis. Thus, by improving the air quality on the Underground network he would significantly reduce the respiratory and heart conditions for those exposed to this harmful air particularly for those commuters making the longest journey's and spending the longest amount of time exposed to this toxic air.\n",

We're aware that one of Khan's toughest decisions involved buying cameras first and then proceeding with the lucrative ULEZ poor tax despite significant opposition during public consultation, and then implementing it regardless, without alienating the majority and downplaying the minority by influencing the BBC to curtail truthful reporting. This was achieved by categorizing vehicles into \"good/new/ who are wealthy people's cars\" and \"bad/old/who are poor people's cars.\" The most vulnerable and voiceless individuals, trapped in car debt and ineligible for the impractical scrapping scheme, are the first to bear the burden.\n",

Damp, molds, and poor air quality within inadequately insulated housing owned by neglectful landlords and councils leave them unable to afford proper heating. An estimated 3.6 million children bear this burden. If the yearly spike in lung conditions is to be believed, perhaps the real causes are closer to home than his ULEZ poor tax on the vulnerable.

What Kahn and the Govt in general need to do is invest heavily in the charging infrastructure so that busineeses and individuals can cope with the 2030 switch when all new cars must be hybrid or zero emission. I also serioiusly question why the Govt and Mayor are wedded to one way of reducing emissions. Why not invest in research into fuels that can run in current engines without causing emissions.

Firstly, at a meeting in March 2022 Khan was asked where he got the data that the poorest Londoners would not be affected as they don’t own cars. Khan was challenged on this response and was asked where he got his statistics from. Khan seemed to confuse the question and it was rephrased asking specifically for the source of that data Khan was referring to. Khan then resorted to using personal attacks to what was a perfectly reasonable question to provide evidence to support his claims. He is an example of another politician that does not have the right character, competence, and level of integrity to serve in the best interests of the public. It was brought up again by Peter Fortune a year later and once again he had nowhere to hide. \r\n",
            "\r\n",
            "The assessed air pollution benefits from the expansion of ULEZ shows no meaningful evidence to support TFL’s claim that the expansion of ULEZ would make a significant difference to London's air quality. It was therefore an easy decision to expand ULEZ as it is solely about implementing a larger catchment area for motorist in London (5.1 million) and those motorists that live outside London but enter the outskirts of Greater London. If Khan had actually researched the actual statistics instead of making up stats to base his assumptions on he would have been in a position to make an informed decision. How long would it have taken for TFL or his office to have compiled or found this data set before committing? Simply denying the impact on low-income households while making false claims of the health benefit does not fix the issue. The London Mayors office and TFL have essentially expanded the ULEZ zone without any proper facts-based consultation. It is also worth stating that if it is an air pollution levy and not a motoring toll why are the profits going to TFL and not say to a charity such as the Heart Foundation Charity or the NHS that support and treat those people effected by air pollution. \r\n",
            "\r\n",
            "Furthermore, it is well known that the highest level of air pollution is not at street level, but on the underground network where measured air pollution is measured as toxic to human health and being forced to use the London Underground is worse for your health. If Khan genuinely cared about reducing the health impacts of air pollution on Londoners, he would be focused on improving fresh air ventilation and other measures to improve air quality on the London Underground network. Sadiq Khan should also note that commuters travelling on the London Underground from Greater London (and outside London) into Central London and back are exposed more to this toxic air on a daily basis. Thus, by improving the air quality on the Underground network he would significantly reduce the respiratory and heart conditions for those exposed to this harmful air particularly for those commuters making the longest journey's and spending the longest amount of time exposed to this toxic air.\n",

Comment: Let's be clear: Sadiq Khan's concern for children's health is questionable, given that he has his own kids living in the city with him and drives his heavy Range Rover a short distance for a dog walk. If pollution truly had such severe consequences, causing illnesses like stunted lungs, asthma, and Alzheimer's, and if it were irrefutably established as the cause, we would expect a more substantial response from actual parents demonstrating outside number 10 and emotional pleas on the news.\n",
            "It's worth noting that few healthy kids died from the flu, yet many were medicated en masse not too long ago £$€. We're aware that one of Khan's toughest decisions involved buying cameras first and then proceeding with the lucrative ULEZ poor tax despite significant opposition during public consultation, and then implementing it regardless, without alienating the majority and downplaying the minority by influencing the BBC to curtail truthful reporting. This was achieved by categorizing vehicles into \"good/new/ who are wealthy people's cars\" and \"bad/old/who are poor people's cars.\" The most vulnerable and voiceless individuals, trapped in car debt and ineligible for the impractical scrapping scheme, are the first to bear the burden.\n",
            "London's congestion issue persists, enabling those who can afford it to continue driving their ULEZ-compliant Range Rover V8s and 31 mpg 2-liter Jaguars to school because walking is deemed too perilous for the rich peoples kids. Meanwhile, carers, nurses, shift workers, joiners, and plumbers who rely on older, more fuel-efficient 55+ mpg vehicles face penalties due to their \"old and bad\" classification.\n",
            "Interestingly, the London Tube contains toxic particles – dust, metal, skin, and clothing fibers – stirred up by passing trains, and air quality inside carriages is 18 times worse than even the most polluted high streets. Despite this, the mayor and TFL maintain that it's safe, withholding studies on air quality that they commissioned themselves.\n",
            "Why not address the dire state of social housing in London, which detrimentally affects children's physical and mental health? Damp, molds, and poor air quality within inadequately insulated housing owned by neglectful landlords and councils leave them unable to afford proper heating. An estimated 3.6 million children bear this burden. If the yearly spike in lung conditions is to be believed, perhaps the real causes are closer to home than his ULEZ poor tax on the vulnerable.

What Kahn and the Govt in general need to do is invest heavily in the charging infrastructure so that busineeses and individuals can cope with the 2030 switch when all new cars must be hybrid or zero emission. I also serioiusly question why the Govt and Mayor are wedded to one way of reducing emissions. Why not invest in research into fuels that can run in current engines without causing emissions. The original diesel engine ran on chip fat and all diesel cars built until around the 1990s could have run on it for some reason car manufacturers changed that just as people started to find out it was possible.\n",

        "\n",
        "There are limitations in the ability of VADER to successfully categorise the comments as seen by the high occurance of false positives. The sentiment scores are often inaccurate due to the use of emojis, abbreviations and British slang and sarcastic tone. Despite this, I have used my results to draw preliminary findings for my research question.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Total Comments Captured**: 355\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Negative: 165 (46.5%)\n",
        "\n",
        "Neutral: 71 (20%)\n",
        "\n",
        "Positive: 119 (12) (3.4%)\n",
        "\n",
        "Upon reading all the comments manually I can confirm that in fact there are only 12 comments that are truly positive in sentiment towards the policy.\n",
        "\n",
        "By separating the comments into positive and negative categories I have been able to identify what the most common words were in each category.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Comments against the policy:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "For the negative comments, when removing the 6 top most frequent words (London, air, just, ULEZ, people, Kahn) I can see that the most common words include **asthma, mayor, underground, public, money.**\n",
        "\n",
        "This reveals that when expressing opposition towards the policy the main concerns are related to health and politics. Specifically, there are questions raised about the amount of money being raised by the policy for the government and whether this public money is being used to effectively reduce carbon emissions in London or fund the public health care system.\n",
        "\n",
        "Secondly, the frequency of both \"Khan\" and \"Mayor\" reveal that the public see the policy as linked to Sadiq Khan. This suggests that the attacks on the policy may also be politicised. For example, the average reader of BBC news typically leans more Conservative and it is possible that the dissent for the policy may in fact be targeted towards the Mayor who is from the labour party.\n",
        "\n",

        "For the positive comments, when removing the 6 top most frequent words the most common words include **kmnowledge, students, social, quality, skills, health, life.**\n",
        "\n",
        "These words all relate to the positive impact that the policy may have on the environment and the  health of Londoners. It also draws on themes from education, knowledge and skills, highlighting that some Londoners may see it as a productive policy. It suggests that with more education on issues related to air pollution in London, and greater knowledge and information sharing on health issues, there may be more people in favour of the policy. This leads me to believe that there may be portions of the public that believe the opposition to the policy is due to a lack of public knowledge of the reason for swapping to electric vehicles or reducing dependency on traditional cars in London.\n",

        "The [scientific evidence](https://www.lse.ac.uk/granthaminstitute/news/the-truth-about-londons-ultra-low-emission-zone/) does in fact confirm that there has been a reduction in emissions and an improvement of air quality in London since ULEZ was introduced. However, despite there being [research](https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/driving/ultra-low-emission-zone/why-we-have-ulez#:~:text=The%20aim%20of%20the%20ULEZ,a%20fifth%20in%20inner%20London) informing the policy, the overall differing opinions in the Youtube comments reveal that there remains misinformation about the policy.\n",
        "\n",
        "Upon studying this further, it is clear that there is high misinformation in London about the leading causes of emissions in London and the potential for ULEZ to address this. Academics from LSE point out the [numerous studies](https://www.lse.ac.uk/granthaminstitute/news/the-truth-about-londons-ultra-low-emission-zone/) confirming the positive impact of the ULEZ policy. However, due to the interest of London MP's wanting to be re-elected there has been an opportunity for politicians to weaponise ULEZ as a way to appeal to lower income households and win votes. Many of these MPs have previously voted alongside climate deniers on other issues.\n"

        "#### Conclusion\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "By understanding the public's reaction to this policy, conclusions can be drawn upon whether the UK should scrap or persist with the ULEZ policy. This study can confirm that the public reaction to the policy has been overwhelmingly negative.\n",
        "\n",
        "On top of this, there appears to be a clearly politicised attack against Mayor Khan from the Labour party as a result of this policy. This is because the issue has become deeply politicised in the UK and is being used as a tool for MPs to gain support in elections.\n",
        "\n",
        "The comments most in favour of the policy were concerned by public health matters. Going forward, if the UK Government wishes to continue with the ULEZ policy there must be significant efforts to provide information to Londoners about the health concerns related to the high pollution in London. Furthermore, there should be better information campaigns to show Londoner's that the scheme has so far been successful in reducing emissions.\n",
        "\n",
        "On the other hand, the major negative reaction to the policy still reveals a deep mistrust of the UK government and the idea that the right to drive in London now requires an exclusively high fee that many cannot afford. The policy has been disruptive to locals and commuters and in general the public has been very resistent to the change. In order for a green policy to be sustainable and effective it must also be equitable. Further work should be done to help provide access to greener modes of transport to all Londoners if this policy will continue to exist.\n",
